# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project applies supervised learning algorithms to assist early diagnosis of breast cancer, improving the chances of effective treatment.

Key Features:

Cleaned and preprocessed medical data (handling missing values, normalization, feature selection).

Applied classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Achieved high accuracy (>95%) on test data using scikit-learn.

Visualized performance with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and ROC curve.

Built a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit (optional).

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
